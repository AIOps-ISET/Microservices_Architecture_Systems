As a result, we start from more than 500 scientific papers published from 2009 to 2021, and extract 144 most significant papers, identify that the main research directions of this field include load balancing, fault detection, and autoscaling. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive description of these research directions, discuss them in particular detail.
There are two rules for determining data elements in this review. One is that the selected data elements must accurately represent the basic information of the paper. The data elements determined by this method include the paper title, the first author, the publication year of the paper and the page number of the paper. Second is the selected data elements must accurately represent the research content of the paper, and the data elements determined by this method include research type, research objective, research background, research method and research technology.
